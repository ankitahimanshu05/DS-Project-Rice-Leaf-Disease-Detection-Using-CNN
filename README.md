Rice is amongst the major cultivated crops in India and its leaf diseases can have a substantial impact on output and quality. The most important component is identifying rice leaf diseases, which have a direct impact on the economy and food security. Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut are the most frequently occurring rice leaf diseases.

These diseases can cause major social and economic problems, due to a variety of factors. Crop diseases can affect its growth and development, and also crop yield and quality, and are one of the most common reasons for productivity loss. To avoid soil pollution, the illness should be detected and certain pesticides should be used from their beginning stage.

Disease detection in leaves is an important topic that provides many benefits in monitoring large fields of crops. Rice leaf disease can affect yield and quality by damaging the green layer from the leaves. The way to control these rice diseases is to rapidly and precisely detect the disease type and then implement appropriate corrective actions promptly. Using digital image processing techniques and deep learning networks, the detection of disease is efficient, consumes less time, and is accurate.

In this Data set, there are 119 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. The different types of diseases classified here are as follows:

1. Bacterial Leaf Blight: In this type, the leaves of the rice plant become light green to greyish green, and water-soaked streaks appear on the leaves but later, they form larger yellowish lesions with uneven edges. Further, the leaves become yellow, gradually wilt, and die.
2. Brown Spot: In this type, numerous big spots appear on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf.
3. Leaf Smut: In this type, small and slightly raised, angular spots appear on both sides of the leaves. Heavily infected leaves turn yellow. Leaf tips die and turn gray.

Important Note: Data Set was a large file so was not uploaded.
